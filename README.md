# phalcon-api-demo
An API draft based on Phalcon Framework

# BEAUTIFUL PRODUCS API Scope

Create an API (using the chosen framework) to support simple operations around products.

# Definition

Methods:
GET /api/products Retrieves all the products
GET /api/products/<id> Retrieves a product by ID (primary key)
POST /api/products/ Adds a new product
DELETE /api/products/<id> Deletes a product based on the ID (primary key)

# Requirements
PHP7
MySQL or SQLite for storage
JWT.io for authentication (no need for keys management, just a single one for demo purposes).
It would be nice to follow http://jsonapi.org/ as standard
